## Technologies Used
In my first website I used html5 and CSS to create a three page website.  Each page shows a stream on a coding course and details the different coding languages that are covered in that stream. Each coding language has a graphic and clicking on each graphic brings the use to a wikipedia page related to that graphic where information on the coding language can be found.
No external code was used.  
It was important for me that each page looked tidy and balanced.  The pages need to look simple, clean, and inviting to the reader, as newcomers to coding do not need to feel confused.
